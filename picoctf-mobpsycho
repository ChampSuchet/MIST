To get the file: wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/53/mobpsycho.apk, then unzip mobpsycho.apk.
It gives a lot of files to look through so by using various common search terms like ctf, pico, and flag this command showed something useful strings * | grep flag. It shows res/color/flag.txt near the end of the output.
To verify, ls -R | grep flag -B 20, which recursively lists out everything and got the 20 lines above flag.txt to see that it is indeed at file in ./res/color directory.
Then the outputs of flag.txt could be retrieved with cat res/color/flag.txt which gives encoded text. You could take the output and put it into CyberChef and decode with Hex or use xxd as shown in this command: cat res/color/flag.txt | xxd -r -p. This gives the flag.
